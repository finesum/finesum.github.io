# **About Me**

Hi This is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I've just started my long journey as a software engineer.
I'm eager to learn, practice and finally contribute to projects that can move the world forward.

Exhibitions and trip, that's what I really like. Especially enjoy feeling the way other people see the world.
Hope these experiences will be incorporated into my project.
